# OopsWrongTab – Save Reputation. Stay Professional.

**OopsWrongTab** is a privacy-first browser extension that automatically redirects awkward, distracting, or unprofessional tabs to a safe fallback page when you're in a meeting or screen sharing — protecting your reputation with one smart redirect.

> Visit the official site: [oopswrongtab.net](https://oopswrongtab.net)

> **Currently in Preview:** This is the initial version (v0.1.0-preview). Redirects are currently set to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) by default. Future updates will include customizable redirect URLs, smart detection, and more.

## Features

- Real-time tab monitoring
- Smart redirect to Google Calendar
- Customizable working hours
- Manageable blocklist for full control
- Emergency hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+H`)

## Who’s It For?

- Remote professionals & freelancers

- Anyone who shares their screen regularly

## How It Works

OopsWrongTab runs silently in the background. When you open or switch to a tab that matches a blocked domain, it will **instantly redirect you** to a professional fallback page.

In this preview version, that fallback page is [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com). More customization options are on the way.
